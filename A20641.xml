            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That <hi>God himſelfe had ſold Iſrael into the hands of Iabin King of

twenty yeeres oppreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he came not,</hi> and yet he came. That <hi>when
Siſera came againſt them, with nine hundred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of Iron,</hi> and all
preparations, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to that, and <hi>God</hi> cald vp a woman, a

<hi>God</hi> would effect his purpoſe by ſo weake an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, by a
woman, but by a woman, which had no ſuch intereſt, nor zeale to the
cauſe; by <hi>Jael:</hi> And in <hi>Iaels</hi> hand, by ſuch an

nayles him to the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10507:4"/> ground, as he lay ſleeping in her tent:
And then the end of all, was the end of all, <hi>not one man of his army left
aliue. O my Soule, why art thou ſo ſad, why art thou ſo diſquieted
within me?</hi> Sing vnto the Lord an old ſong, the ſong of
<hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> That God by weake meanes doth mighty
workes, That all Gods creatures fight in his behalfe, <hi>They fought from

                  </p>
                  <p>You ſhal haue but two parts out of theſe words; And to
make theſe two parts,<note place="margin">Diuiſion.</note> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the
Text, as the two <hi>Hemiſpheres</hi> of the world, laid open in a flat, in a
plaine Map. All thoſe parts of the world, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients haue vſed to
conſider, are in one of thoſe <hi>Hemiſpheres;</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi>
is in that, and in that is all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Afrike</hi> too: So
that when we haue ſeene that <hi>Hemiſphere,</hi> done with that, we might
ſeeme to haue ſeene all, done with all the world; but yet the other
<hi>Hemiſphere,</hi> that of <hi>America</hi> is as big as it; though, but by
occaſion of new, and late diſcoueries, we had had nothing to ſay of
<hi>America.</hi> So the firſt part of our Text, will bee as that firſt
<hi>Hemiſphere;</hi> all which the <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10507:5"/> ancient Expoſitors
found occaſion to note out of theſe words, will be in that: but by the new
diſcoueries of ſome humors of men, and rumors of men, we ſhall haue
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſay ſomewhat of a ſecond part to. The parts are, firſt,
the Literall, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall ſenſe of the words; And then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent,
a collaterall, an occaſionall ſenſe of them. The <hi>explication</hi> of
the wordes, and the <hi>Application, Quid tunc, Quid nunc,</hi> How the words
were ſpoken then, How they may be applied now, will be our two parts. And, in
paſſing through our firſt, wee ſhall make theſe ſteps. Firſt, God
can, and ſometimes doth effect his purpoſes by himſelfe; intirely,
immediatly, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, miraculouſly by himſelfe: But yet, in a
ſecond place, we ſhall ſee, by this ſtory, That he lookes for
aſſiſtance, for concurrence of ſecond cauſes, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
meanes: And that therefore, <hi>God</hi> in this Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> hath
prouided an honourable commemoration of them, who did aſſiſt his cauſe;

is <hi>Lord of Hostes,</hi> and fights his owne battailes, I am farre from
giuing fire to them that deſire warre. <hi>Peace</hi> in this world, is a
pretious <hi>Earneſt,</hi> and a faire and louely <hi>Type</hi> of the
euerlaſting peace of the world to come: And warre in this world, is a
ſhrewd and fearefull <hi>Embleme</hi> of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <pb n="9" facs="tcp:10507:6"/> diſcord and tumult, and torment of the world to come: And therefore,
our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God,</hi> bleſſe vs with this externall, and this
internall, and make that lead vs to an eternall peace. But I ſpeake of this
ſubiect, eſpecially to eſtabliſh and ſettle them, that ſuſpect
Gods power, or Gods purpoſe, to ſuccour thoſe, who in forraine parts,
grone vnder heauie preſſures in matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or to
reſtore thoſe, who in forraine parts, are deueſted of their lawfull
poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and inheritance; and becauſe <hi>God</hi> hath not done
theſe great workes yet, nor yet raiſed vp meanes, in apparance, and in
their apprehenſion, likely to effect it, That therefore <hi>God</hi> likes
not the cauſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin to bee ſhaked in their owne
Religion at home, ſince they thinke that God neglects it abroad. But,
beloued, ſince God made all this world of nothing, cannot hee recouer any one
peece thereof, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore any one peece, with a little? In the Creation, his
production of ſpecifique formes, and ſeuerall Creatures in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
dayes, was much, very much; but not very much, compared with that, which 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10507:7"/> he had done immediatly before, when he made Heauen and
Earth of nothing. For, for the particular Creatures, God had then
<hi>Praeiacentem Materiam,</hi> he had ſtuffe before him; enough to cut out
Creatures of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſiſe, his <hi>Elephants</hi> of the Earth, his
<hi>Whales</hi> and <hi>Leuiathans</hi> in the Sea. In that matter there was
<hi>Semen Creaturarum,</hi> The Seed of all Creatures in that ſtuffe. But for
the ſtuffe it ſelfe, the Heauen and Earth, God had not <hi>Semen
Coeli,</hi> any ſuch ſeed of Heauen as that he could ſay to it, doe thou
hatch a Heauen; he had not any ſuch <hi>Semen terrae,</hi> as that hee could
bid that grow vp into an Earth: There was nothing at all, and all, that is, was
produced from that; and then who ſhall doubt of his proceeding, if by a
little he will doe much? He ſuffered his greater works to be paraleld, or to
be counterfeit by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs Magicians,</hi> but in his leaſt, in the
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lice, hee brought them to confeſſe <hi>Digitum Dei,</hi> the
finger of God; and that was enough; The arme of God, the hand of God needs not;
where he will worke, his finger is enough, It was not that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that
dreame of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that hind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <pb n="11" facs="tcp:10507:7"/> the
<hi>Magicians,</hi> who ſay, that the <hi>Deuill</hi> cannot make any
Creature, leſſe then a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley corne; As it is with men, they
miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be with the <hi>Deuill</hi> too; harder to make a little
clocke, a little picture, any thing in a little, then in a larger forme. That
was no part of the reaſon in that caſe: but ſince man ordinarily
eſteemes it ſo, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily admires great workes in little forme, why
will he not be content to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>God</hi> that way, in a faithfull
confidence, that hee can and will doe great workes by weake meanes. Should God
haue ſtayd to leuie, and arme, and traine, and muſter, and preſent men
enow to diſcomfit <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib?</hi> Hee tooke a neerer way; he ſlew

<hi>Reg.</hi> 5.16.</note> he brought him to acknowledge, that there were more
with them, then with the <hi>Enemy,</hi> when there was none. He troubled not
ſo much as a cloud, he imployed no Creature at all, againſt the
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 5</note> when
they came vp with thirty thouſand <hi>Chariots;</hi> but hee

imprinted a diuine terror in their hearts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iud.</hi>

diminution of his honour, in the augmentation of <hi>Iſraels</hi> forces, and
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reduced <hi>Gideons</hi> thirty two thouſand to three hundred
perſons. It was ſo in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, God does much with few, and it was ſo
in time, God does much, though late; though God ſeeme a long time to haue
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his people, yet in due time, that is, in his time, he returnes to them
againe. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes a vſefull Hiſtoricall note, That that
land to which <hi>God</hi> brought the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
was their owne land before; they were the right heires to it, lineally
deſcended from him, who was the firſt poſſeſſor of it, after the
floud: but they were ſo long out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, as that they
were neuer able to ſet their title on foot; nay, they did ſcarce know their
own title, and yet <hi>God</hi> repoſſeſſed them of it, reinueſted
them in it. It is ſo for <hi>perſons,</hi> and <hi>times</hi> in his wayes
in this world, Much with few, much though late, and it is ſo in his wayes to
the next world too: for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Elias</hi> knew of no more but
himſelfe, <pb n="13" facs="tcp:10507:8"/> that ſerued the right <hi>God</hi> aright:
<hi>God</hi> makes him know that there were ſeuen thouſand more; ſeuen
thouſand was much to one, but it was little to all the world: and yet theſe
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thouſand haue peopled heauen, and ſent vp all thoſe
<hi>Colonies</hi> thither; all thoſe <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
thoſe flockes of <hi>Lambes,</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent children, thoſe
<hi>Fathers,</hi> the Fathers of the Church, and <hi>Mothers,</hi> holy
Matrons, and daughters, bleſſed <hi>Virgines,</hi> and learned and
laborious <hi>Doctors;</hi> theſe ſeuen thouſand haue filled vp the
places of the fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> and repeopled that Kingdome: And
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we thinke them moſt worne out, <hi>God</hi> at this time hath

                        <hi>Rom.</hi>

much though late, in that way too, thou mayeſt diſcerne in his working vpon
thy ſelfe. How often haſt thou ſuffered thy <hi>Soule,</hi> to grow
cleane out of all reparations into ruine, by thine inconſiderate and
habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall courſe of ſinne, and neuer repaired it by any good vſe of
hearing the word, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in a long time, and 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10507:9"/> when thou haſt at any time, come to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of thy

of <hi>Gods</hi> anger, and his inacceſſibleneſſe, his
inexorableneſſe towards thee, and ſunke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the iawes of
deſperation; And yet, <hi>Quia manet ſemen dei,</hi> becauſe the ſeed

                     <hi>Incubat Spiritus,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt hath ſat vpon that

aſſurance of the Mercy of thy God. Recollect all; in rayſing of ſieges,
and diſcomfiting of Armies, in reſtoring poſſeſſions, and
reinueſting right heires, in repairing the ruines of the Kingdome of heauen,
depopulated in the fall of <hi>Angels,</hi> in reeſtabliſhing peace of
conſcience; in a preſumptuous confidence, or ouer-timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diffidence in
<hi>God, God</hi> glorifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that way, to doe much with little.</p>
                  <p>He does ſo; but yet hee will haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>God</hi>
is a good <hi>Husband,</hi> a good <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of Mans contributions, but

hee does not ſo: Hee askes his <hi>Diſciples, Quot panes habetis;</hi> How
many loafes haue you? and though they were but fiue, yet ſince they were
ſome, he multiplies them, and feeds aboue fiue thouſand with thoſe fiue.
Hee would haue a remnant of <hi>Gedeons Armie</hi> to fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes: A
remnant of <hi>Iſraels beleeuers</hi> to make vp his Kingdome; A remnant of
thy <hi>Soule,</hi> his ſeed wrapd vp ſomewhere, to ſaue thy

<hi>God</hi> goes lowe, and accepts ſmall Sacrifices; a Pigeon, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of Flower, a few eares of Corne; but a Sacrifice he will haue. The

Giue Peace in our time, O <pb n="16" facs="tcp:10507:10"/> Lord, becauſe there is no

if the band of the Communion of Saints be diſſolued, we fight for none,
none fights for vs, at laſt neyther we nor they ſhall fight for

of your Children. It is noted (perchaunce but out of leuity) that your Children
doe not keepe that which you get: It is but a calumny, or but a faſcination
of ill wiſhers. We haue many happy inſtances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, many noble

Profeſſion, of no ſenſe of other Mens miſeries, and yet they
aſſiſt this cauſe. Men that ſucke the ſweet of the Earth, and the
ſweat of other Men: Men that pay the State nothing in doing the offices of
mutuall ſocietie, and embracing particular vocations; Men that make
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues but pipes to receiue and conuay, and vent rumors, but ſpunges
to ſucke in, and powre out foule water; Men that doe not ſpend time, but
weare time, they trade not, they plough not, they preach not, they plead not,
but walke, and walke vpon the way, till they haue walked out their ſixe

                  <p>And leſſe; that is, <hi>Poorer</hi> then theſe: for in
the <hi>Second</hi> verſe, the people are as forward <pb n="26" facs="tcp:10507:15"/> as
the <hi>Gouernors,</hi> in the <hi>Ninth, They offered themſelues
willingly.</hi> They might offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, their perſons. It is likely
they did; and likely that many of them had nothing to offer but themſelues.
And when Men of that pouertie offer, part eaſily with that which was hardly
got, how acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> that Sacrifice is, we ſee in
<hi>Chriſts</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of that <hi>Widdow,</hi> who amongſt many
great giuers gaue her Mite, <hi>That ſhee gaue more then all they, becauſe
ſhee gaue all:</hi> which teſtified not onely her <hi>Liberalitie</hi> to
God, but her <hi>Confidence</hi> in God, that though ſhee left nothing,
ſhee ſhould not lacke: for that right vſe doth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
make of that example, <hi>Diuites largiuntur ſecuri de diuitijs, pauper
ſecurus de Domino: A rich man giues, and feeles it not, feares no want,
becauſe hee is ſure of a full Cheſt at home; A poore man giues, and
feeles it as little, becauſe hee is ſure of a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull God in
Heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> then can worke alone; there wee ſet out: yet he
does require aſſiſtance; that way wee went: And to thoſe that doe
aſſiſt, hee giues glory here; ſo farre we are gone: but yet this
remaynes, that hee layes notes of <pb n="27" facs="tcp:10507:15"/> blame, and reproach vpon
them, whom collaterall reſpects withdrew from this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. For
there is a kind of reproach and increpation laide vpon <hi>Reuben</hi> in that
queſtion, <hi>Why abodeſt thou amongst the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſe</hi> 16.</note> 
                     <hi>The diuiſions of</hi> REVBEN
<hi>were great thoughts of heart.</hi> Ambition of precedencie in places of
employment, greatnes of heart, and a lothneſſe to be vnder the commaund of
any other, and ſo an incoherence, not concurring in Counſailes and
Executions, retard oftentimes euen the cauſe of God. So is there alſo a
reproach and increpation vpon <hi>Dan,</hi> in that queſtion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſe</hi> 17.</note> why did <hi>Dan</hi> remaine in his
ſhips; A confidence in their owne ſtrength, a ſacrificing to their owne
Nets, an attributing of their ſecuritie to their owne wiſedome or power,
may alſo retard the cauſe of God; that ſtayed <hi>Dan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>
                  <p>Thus then they haue their <hi>thankes</hi> that doe, thus
their <hi>markes</hi> that doe not aſſiſt in <hi>Gods</hi> cauſe:
though <hi>God</hi> to encourage them that doe, accompliſh his worke
himſelfe, <hi>They fought from heauen, The Starres in their order fought
againſt Siſera. They fought,</hi> ſayes <pb n="28" facs="tcp:10507:16"/> the
<hi>Text,</hi> but does not tell vs who; leaſt men ſhould direct their
thankes for that which is paſt, or their prayers for future benefits, to any
other, euen in heauen, then to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The ſtars are nam'd;
It could not be feared that Men would pray to them, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to them,
<hi>Angels</hi> &amp; <hi>Saints</hi> are not named; Men might come to
aſcribe to them, that which appertained to <hi>God</hi> onely. Now theſe
<hi>Stars,</hi> ſayes the text, <hi>fought in their courſes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes in
Ordine,</hi> they fought not diſorderly. It was no <hi>Enchantment,</hi> no
<hi>Sorcery,</hi> no diſord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the frame, or the powers, or the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of theſe heauenly bodies, in fauor of the <hi>Iſraelites;
God</hi> would not be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the <hi>Deuill,</hi> or to <hi>Witches,</hi>
for his beſt friends. It was no diſorderly Enchantment, nor it was no
<hi>Miracle,</hi> that diſordered theſe Starres; as in <hi>Ioſuahs</hi>
time, the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> were diſordred in their Motions;
But as <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> who relates this battaile more particularly,
ſayes, with whom all agree, <hi>The naturall Influence of theſe heauenly
bodies, at this time, had created and gathered ſuch ſtormes and hayles, as
blowing vehemently in the Enemies face, was the cauſe of this defeate:</hi>
for ſo wee <pb n="29" facs="tcp:10507:16"/> might haue ſaid, in that deliuerance, which
God gaue vs at <hi>Sea, They fought from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, The Starres in their order
fought againſt the Enemie.</hi> Without coniuring, without <hi>Miracle,</hi>
from heauen, but yet by naturall meanes, God preſerued vs. For that is the
force of that phraſe, and of that maner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing it, <hi>Manentes in
Ordine, The Starres, containing themſelues in their Order, fought.</hi> And
that phraſe induces our ſecond part, the accommodation, the occaſionall
appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe words: <hi>God will not fight, nor be fought for
diſorderly;</hi> And therefore in illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and confirmation of
thoſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle, Let all things be done decently, and in
order, Aquinas,</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place, cites, and
applies this Text, as words to the ſame purpoſe, and of the ſame
ſignification. You, ſayes Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> you who are Stars in the
Church, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in your warfare, decently, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the
ſtars of heauen, when they fight for the <hi>Lord,</hi> they doe their
ſeruice, <hi>Manen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in Ordine, containing themſelues in their
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> And ſo in our order, we are come to our ſecond part. In which
we owe you by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <pb n="30" facs="tcp:10507:17"/> made at firſt, an
<hi>Analyſis,</hi> a diſtribution of the ſteps and branches of this part,
now when wee are come to the handling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And thus wee ſhall proceede;
firſt, the <hi>Warre,</hi> which wee are to ſpeake of here, is not as
before, a <hi>Worldly warre,</hi> it is a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall War:</hi> And then
the <hi>Munition,</hi> the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for this warre, is not as before,
tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſiſtance of <hi>Princes, Officers, Iudges, Merchants,</hi>
all ſorts of <hi>People,</hi> but it is the <hi>Goſpell of Chriſt
Ieſus, and the preaching thereof.</hi> Preaching is <hi>Gods</hi> ordinance,
with that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> hee fights from heauen, and batters downe all
errors. And thirdly, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this War, he hath made <hi>Preachers
Stars;</hi> and <hi>vae ſi non, woe be vnto them, if they doe not fight, if
they doe not preach:</hi> But yet in the laſt place, they muſt fight, as
the Stars in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doe, <hi>In their order,</hi> in that Order, and
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe directions, which, they, to whom it appertaines, ſhall
giue them: for that is <hi>to fight in Order.</hi> And in theſe foure
branches, wee ſhall determine this ſecond part.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we are in Contemplation of <hi>a Spirituall
warre;</hi> now, though there be a <pb n="31" facs="tcp:10507:17"/> 
                     <hi>Beatie
Pacifici,</hi> a bleſſing reſerued to <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi> to <hi>the
Peace-maker, our Peace-maker, who</hi> hath ſometimes effected it in ſome
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and alwayes ſeriouſly and chargeably, and honourably endeuoured it
in all places, yet there is a <hi>ſpirituall Warre,</hi> in which,
<hi>Maledicti Pacifici;</hi> Curſed bee they that goe about to make Peace,
and to make all one, The warres betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Beliall. Let
no man ſeuer thoſe whom God hath ioyned,</hi> but let no Man ioyne thoſe
whom <hi>God</hi> hath ſeuered neyther, and <hi>God</hi> hath ſeuered
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial:</hi> and that was <hi>Gods</hi> action,
<hi>Ponam inimicitias;</hi> The Seed of the woman, and the Seed of the Serpent,
wee and the Deuill, ſhould neuer haue fallen out; wee agree but too well; but
God hath put an enmity betweene vs. God hath put <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Falſhood, Jdolatrie</hi> and <hi>Sinceritie</hi> ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
and infuſed ſuch an incompatibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and imprinted ſuch an
implacabilitie betweene them, as that they cannot flow into one another: And
therefore, there, <hi>Maledicti Pacifici,</hi> It is an oppoſition againſt
God, by any colourable Modifications, to reconcile opinions diametrally
contrary to <pb n="32" facs="tcp:10507:18"/> one another, in fundamentall things.
<hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> may ioyne and meet. <hi>In Diluculis</hi> and
in <hi>Crepuſculis,</hi> The dawning of the day, in the Morning, and the
ſhutting in of the day in the Euening, make day and night ſo much one, as
ſometimes you cannot tell which to call them: but <hi>Lux &amp;
tenebrae,</hi> light and darknes, <hi>Midnight</hi> and <hi>Noone</hi> neuer
met, neuer ioynd. There are points, which paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and vehemence
of diſputation, haue carried farther a ſunder then needed: and theſe
indeed haue made the greateſt noyſe; becauſe vpon theſe, for the moſt
part, depends the matter of profit: and <hi>Beati paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici,</hi> bleſſed
were that labour, and that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that could reconcile thoſe things; and
of that there might bee hope, becauſe it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but the Perſons that
fight, it is not the thing, the matters are not ſo different. But then there
are matters ſo different, as that a Man may ſit at home, and weepe, and
wiſh, prayſe God that hee is in the right, and pray to God for them that
are in the wrong, but to thinke that they are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and <hi>all one,
Maledicti Pacifici,</hi> hee that hath brought ſuch a Peace, hath 
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10507:18"/> brought a curſe vpon his owne Conſcience, and laid,
not a <hi>Satisfastion,</hi> but a <hi>Scupefaction</hi> vpon it. A
<hi>Turke</hi> might perchance ſay, in ſcorne of vs both, They call you
<hi>Heretiques,</hi> you call them <hi>Idolaters,</hi> why might not
<hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> and <hi>Heretiques</hi> agree well enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? But a
true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will neuer make <hi>Contrarieties in fundamentall
things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> neuer make foundations, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peredifications, the
Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the Traditions of men, all one. Euery man is a little
world, ſayes the <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> Euery man is a little
<hi>Church</hi> too; and in euery man there are two ſides, two armies: the
fleſh fights againſt the Spirit. This is but a <hi>Ciuill warre,</hi> nay
it is but a <hi>Rebellion</hi> indeed; and yet it can neuer be abſolutely
quenched. So euery man is alſo a Souldier in that great and generall warre,
betweene <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Beliall,</hi> the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and
the will of man. Euery man is bound to hearken to a peace, in ſuch things as
may admit peace, in differences, where men differ from men; but bound alſo to
ſhut himſelfe vp againſt all ouertures of peace, in ſuch things, as are
in their Nature irreconcileable, in differences <pb n="34" facs="tcp:10507:19"/> where men
differ from <hi>God.</hi> That warre <hi>God</hi> hath kindled, and that warre
muſt bee maintain'd, and maintain'd by his way; and his way, and his
<hi>Ordinance</hi> in this warre, is Preaching.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>God</hi> had not ſaid to <hi>Noah, Fac tibi
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam;</hi> and when he had ſaid ſo, if he had not giuen him a
<hi>Deſeigne,</hi> a <hi>Modell,</hi> a <hi>Platforme</hi> of that
<hi>Arke,</hi> we may doubt credibly, whether euer man would haue thought of a
<hi>Ship,</hi> or of any ſuch way of trade &amp; Commerce. Shipping was Gods
owne Inuention, and therein <hi>Laetentur Inſulae,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi>
ſayes, <hi>Let the Ilands reioyce.</hi> So alſo, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had
not ſaid to his <hi>Apostles, Ite praedicate, Goe and preach:</hi> And when
he had ſaid ſo, ſaid thus much more, <hi>Qui non crediderit damnabitur,
Hee that beleeues not your Preaching, ſhall be damned:</hi> certainly man
would neuer haue thought of ſuch a way of eſtabliſhing a kingdome, as by
Preaching. No other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had any ſuch Inſtitution, as Preaching. In the
<hi>Romane</hi> State, there was a publique Officer, <hi>Conditor Precum,</hi>
who vpon great emergent occaſions, deprecations of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, or
Gratulations for euident <pb n="35" facs="tcp:10507:19"/> benefites, did make particular
<hi>Collects</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe occaſions: And ſome ſuch
occaſionall <hi>Panegyriques,</hi> and gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Orations for temporall
benefites, they had in that <hi>State.</hi> But a fixt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe
of conteining Subiects in their Religious and Ciuill duties, by preaching,
onely <hi>God</hi> ordain'd, onely his Children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy'd. <hi>Chriſt</hi>
when he ſent his <hi>Apostles,</hi> did not giue them a particular command,
<hi>Ite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> goe and pray in the publique Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; All Nations
were accuſtomed to that; <hi>Chriſt</hi> made no doubt of any mans
oppoſing, or queſtioning Publique Prayer; and therefore for that, he onely
ſaid, <hi>Sic ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitis,</hi> Not goe, and pray, but, <hi>when you pray, pray
thus,</hi> hee inſtructed them in the forme; the dutie was well knowne to all
before. But, for Preaching, He himſelfe was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that, <hi>The
Spirit of the Lord is vpon me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſa. 61.1</note>
                     <hi>becauſe the Lord hath anoynted mee to preach:</hi> His vnction was his

of his owne vnction: <hi>All power is giuen vnto mee,</hi> ſayes hee, <hi>in

                     <hi>and
preach:</hi> Becauſe I haue all power, for preaching, take yee part of my
power, and preach too. For, Preaching is <hi>the power of God vnto Saluation,

                     <hi>Quench not the Spirit,
Nec in te, nec in alio,</hi> ſayes <hi>Aquinas;</hi> Quench it not in your
ſelfe, by forbearing to heare the Word preached; quench it not in others, by
diſcouraging them that doe preach. For ſo Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
(and not hee alone) vnderſtood that place, <hi>That they quench the ſpirit,
who diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance preaching, and diſhearten Preachers.</hi> Saint
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> took his example from the <hi>lampe</hi> that burnt by
him, when he was preaching; (It ſeemes therefore hee did preach in the
afternoone) and he ſayes, <hi>You may quench this Lampe, by putting in water,
and you may quench it by taking out the oyle.</hi> So a man may quench the
ſpirit in himſelfe, if he ſmoother it, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focate it with worldly
pleaſures, or profits, and he may quench it in others, if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw that
fauour, or that help, which keeps that Man, who hath the ſpirit of
Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the Vnction of Preaching, in a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſcharge of his
dutie. Preaching then <pb n="37" facs="tcp:10507:20"/> being <hi>Gods Ordinance</hi> to
beget Faith, to take away preaching, were to diſarme <hi>God,</hi> and to
quench the ſpirit; for by that <hi>Ordinance he fights from heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to maintaine that fight, he hath made his <hi>Miniſters
Starres;</hi> as they are called in the firſt of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> And
they fight againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> that is, they preach againſt
<hi>Error.</hi> They preach out of Neceſsitie; <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie is laid

                  <p>In this phraſe, as we told you before, out of
<hi>Aquinas,</hi> the ſame thing is intended, as in that place of Saint
<hi>Paul, Let all things bee done decently, and in Order.</hi> That the
<hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Edition</hi> reades, <hi>Fiant honeste;</hi> and then ſayes Saint
<hi>Ambroſe, Honeſte fit, quod cum pace fit, That is done honeſtly, and
decently, which is done quietly, and peaceably.</hi> Not with a peace, and
indifferencie to contrary Opinions in fundamentall Doctrines, not to ſhuffle
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions together, and make it all one which you chuſe, but a peace with
perſons, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from contumelies, and reuilings. It is true that
wee muſt hate Gods enemies with <hi>a perfect hatred,</hi> and it is true
that <hi>Saint Chryſostome</hi> ſayes, <hi>Odium perfectum eſt, odium
conſummatiſsimum,</hi> that is not a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, that leaues out any
of their Errors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hated. <pb n="40" facs="tcp:10507:22"/> But yet a perfect hatred is that
too, which may conſiſt with perfection, and Charitie is perfection: a

which is ſtill to hate <hi>Errors,</hi> not <hi>Perſons.</hi> When their

Army is but a great Ryot; and without this decencie, this peaceableneſſe,
this diſcretion, this Order, zeale is but fury, and ſuch preaching is but
to the obduration of ill, not to the edification of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> in his abſence from the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.5.</note> reioyces as much in beholding their
<hi>Order,</hi> as in their ſtedfaſtneſſe in the faith of <hi>Chriſt
Ieſus:</hi> Nay, if wee conſider the words well, as Saint
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath done, we ſhall ſee that it is only their
<hi>Order</hi> that he reioyces in: for <hi>Non dixit fidem, ſed firmamentum
fidei,</hi> ſayes that Father, <hi>It was not their faith, but that which
eſtabliſhed their faith, <pb n="41" facs="tcp:10507:22"/> that was their order, that
occaſioned his ioy.</hi> For when there is not an vniforme, a comely, an
orderly preſenting of matters of faith, faith it ſelfe growes looſe, and
loſes her eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and preaching in the <hi>Church</hi> comes to bee as

<hi>Man,</hi> we conſider a two-fold <hi>Order</hi> One, as all creatures

<hi>the body</hi> ſpeaks not, the <hi>head</hi> does. It is the <hi>Head of

                  <p>This the <hi>Royall</hi> and <hi>religious Head</hi> of
theſe <hi>Churches</hi> within his Dominions hath lately had occaſion to
do. And in doing this, doth he innouate any thing, offer to doe any new 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10507:24"/> thing? Do we repent that <hi>Canon,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which at his <hi>Maieſties</hi> firſt comming

                     </hi>
we made, <hi>That the King had the ſame authoritie in cauſes

<hi>Kings of Iudah,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Emperors</hi> did? We are not, wee
know them well. Take it where the power of the <hi>Empire</hi> may ſeem
ſomwhat declind in <hi>Charls the great;</hi> we ſee by thoſe
<hi>Capitularies</hi> of his, that remain yet, what <hi>orders</hi> he gaue in

preſcribe Orders in theſe caſes, Nam legimus quid Ioſias fecerit, We
haue red what Ioſiah did, and we know that wee haue the ſame Authoritie
that Ioſiah had.</hi> But, that <hi>Emperor</hi> conſulted with his
<hi>Clergie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he publiſhed thoſe <hi>Orders.</hi> It is true,
he ſayes he did. But he, from whom we haue receiued theſe <hi>Orders,</hi>
did more then ſo; His <hi>Maieſty</hi> forbore, til a repreſentation of
ſome inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces by diſorderly preaching, was made to him, by thoſe in

graue and reuerend <hi>Prelates</hi> of this <hi>Church;</hi> they preſented
it to him, and thereupon hee entred into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. But that
<hi>Emperour</hi> did but declare things conſtituted by other Councells
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but yet the giuing the life of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe Conſtitutions
in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was introductorie, and many of the things themſelues were
ſo. Amongſt them, his 70. <hi>Capitularie</hi> is appliable to our
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe; there hee ſayes, <hi>Epiſcopi videant, That the
Biſhops take care, that all Preachers preach to the people the Expoſition
of the Lordes Prayer:</hi> and he enioynes them too, <hi>Ne quid nouum, ne quid
non Canonicum, That no man preach any new opinion of his owne;</hi> nay, though
it bee the opinion of other learned men in other places, yet if it be <hi>Non

                  </p>
                  <p>That is not new then, which the <hi>Kings of Iudah</hi> did,
and which the <hi>Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> did. But it is new to vs, if the
<hi>Kings</hi> of this kingdome haue not done it. Haue <pb n="47" facs="tcp:10507:25"/>
they not done it? How little the <hi>Kings</hi> of this kingdome did in
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> cauſes then, when by their conniuence that power
was deuold into a forraine Prelates hand, it is pitie to conſider, pitie to
remember, pitie to bring into Contemplation; And yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen then our Kings
did exerciſe more of that power, then our aduerſaries who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it,
will confeſſe. But, ſince the true iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction was vindicated, and
reapplyed to the Crowne, in what iuſt height <hi>Henrie the eight,</hi> and
thoſe who gouerned his Sonnes minoritie, <hi>Edward the ſixt,</hi>
exerciſed that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> cauſes, none,
that knowes their Story, knowes not. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ordinarily, wee ſettle
our ſelues beſt in the Actions, and Precedents of the late <hi>Queene</hi>
of bleſſed and euerlaſting memory, I may haue leaue to remember them that
know, and to tell them that know not, one act of her power and her wiſedome,
to this purpoſe. When ſome <hi>Articles</hi> concerning the falling away
from iuſtifying grace, and other poynts that beat vpon that haunt; had been
ventilated, in Conuenticle, and in Pulpits too, and Preaching on both ſides 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10507:26"/> paſt, and that ſome perſons of great place and
eſtimation in our <hi>Church,</hi> together with him who was the greateſt
of all, amongſt our Clergy, had vpon mature deliberation eſtabliſhed a
reſolution what ſhould bee thought, and taught, held and preached in
thoſe poynts, and had thereupon ſent down that reſolution to be
publiſhed in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, not vulgarly neither, to the people, but in
a Sermon, <hi>Ad Clerum</hi> onely, yet her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> being informed
thereof, declared her diſpleaſure ſo, as that, ſcarce any houres before
the Sermon was to haue been, there was a Countermaund, an Inhibition to the
Preacher for medling with any of thoſe poynts. Not that her
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> made her ſelfe <hi>Iudge of the Doctrines,</hi> but that
nothing, not formerly declared to be ſo, ought to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the
<hi>Tenet,</hi> and Doctrine of this Church, her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> not being
acquainted, nor ſuplicated to giue her gracious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the
publication thereof.</p>
                  <p>His ſacred <hi>Maiestie</hi> then, is herein vpon the
ſteps of the <hi>Kings of Iudah,</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors,</hi>
of the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> of all the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> that
embraced the <pb n="49" facs="tcp:10507:26"/> Reformation, of <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> her
ſelfe; and he is vpon <hi>his owne</hi> ſteps too. For, it is a ſeditious
calumny to apply this which is done now, to any occaſion that riſes but
now: as though the <hi>King</hi> had done this, now, for ſatisfaction of any
perſons at this time. For ſome yeares ſince, when he was pleaſed to
call the <hi>Heads of Houſes</hi> from the Vniuerſity, and intimate to them
the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences that aroſe from the Preaching of ſuch men, as were not
at all conuerſant in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>Schoole,</hi> nor in
the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Storie,</hi> but had ſhut vp themſelues in a
few later <hi>Writers;</hi> and gaue order to thoſe <hi>Gouernours</hi> for
remedy herein, Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, then he laid the foundation for that, in which
hee hath proceeded thus much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, to reduce Preaching neerer to the
manner of thoſe Primitiue times, when <hi>God</hi> gaue ſo euident, and
ſo remarkable bleſsings to mens Preaching.</p>
                  <p>Conſider more particularly that which he hath done now; His
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his moſt gracious Letter to the
<hi>moſt Reuerend Father in God, my Lords Grace of Canterbury,</hi> with
certaine <hi>Directions</hi> how <pb n="50" facs="tcp:10507:27"/> Preachers ought to behaue
themſelues in the exerciſe of <hi>that part</hi> of their Miniſterie.
Theſe being deriued from his <hi>Grace,</hi> in due courſe to his
<hi>reuerend Brethren,</hi> the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> our <hi>worthy
Dioceſan,</hi> euer vigilant for the Peace and vnitie of the <hi>Church,</hi>
gaue a ſpeedy, very ſpeedy intimation thereof, to the <hi>Clergie</hi> of
his Iuriſdiction; ſo did others, to whom it appertain'd ſo to doe in
theirs. Since that, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> who alwayes taking good workes in
hand, loues to perfect his owne works, hath vouchſafed to giue ſome
<hi>Reaſons</hi> of this his proceeding; which being ſignified by him to
whom the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> owes much, <hi>The right Reuerend
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, the Biſhop of Lincolne, Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the great Seale,</hi>
and after by him alſo, who began at firſt, his <hi>Maieſties</hi>
pleaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing thereby, (as he is too <hi>Great,</hi> and too
<hi>Good</hi> a <hi>King</hi> to ſeeke corners, or diſguiſes, for his
actions) that theſe proceedings ſhould be made publique, I was not willing
only, but glad to haue my part therein, that as, in the feare of God, I haue
alwaies preached to you the <hi>Gospell of Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who is the
<hi>God</hi> of your Saluation; So in the teſtimony <pb n="51" facs="tcp:10507:27"/> of a
good Conſcience, I might now preach to you, <hi>the Goſpel of the Holy
ghoſt,</hi> who is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> of vnitie, and concord.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Directions</hi> then, and the <hi>Reaſons</hi>
of them, by his <hi>Maieſties</hi> particular care, euery man in the
Miniſtery may ſee &amp; write out, in the ſeuerall <hi>Registers
Offices,</hi> with his owne hand for nothing, and for very little, if hee vſe
the hand of another. Perchance you haue, at your conuenience, you may ſee
them. When you do, you ſhall ſee, That his <hi>Maieſties</hi> generall
intention therein is, to put a difference, between graue, and ſolid, from
light and humerous preaching. <hi>Origen</hi> does ſo, when vpon the
<hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>There is a great
difference, Inter praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, &amp; docere:</hi> A man may teach an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
that is, make them know ſomething that they knew not before, and yet not
Preach; for Preaching is to make them know things appertaining to their
ſaluation. But when men doe neither, neither Teach, nor Preach, but (as his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> obſerues the manner to bee) <hi>To ſoare in poynts too
deepe, To muſter vp their owne Reading, To diſplay their owne Wit, or
Ignorance in medling with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <pb n="52" facs="tcp:10507:28"/> matters,</hi> or (as his
<hi>Maiestie</hi> addes) <hi>in rude and vndecent reuiling of perſons:</hi>
this is that which hath drawen downe his <hi>Maieſties</hi> piercing Eye to
ſee it, and his Royall care to correct it. Hee corrects it by
<hi>Chriſts</hi> owne way, <hi>Quid ab initio,</hi> by conſidering how it
was at firſt: for, (as himſelfe to right pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe cites
<hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>Id verum quod primum; That is best, which was
first.</hi> Hee would therefore haue vs conuerſant in <hi>Antiquitie:</hi>
For, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> askes that queſtion with ſome ſcorne, <hi>Quis

fingit.</hi> Can any man hope to make a good Preacher, as ſoone as a good
Picture? In three or foure dayes, or with three or foure Books? His
<hi>Maieſty</hi> therfore cals vs to look, <hi>Quid primum,</hi> what was
firſt in the whole <hi>Church?</hi> And againe, <hi>Quid primum,</hi> when we
receiued the Reformation in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by what meanes, (as his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>Papiſtry was driuen out, and
Puritaniſme kept out, and wee deliuered from the Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the
Papiſt, and the madneſſe of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> as before hee
expreſſeth it: and his religious and iudicious eye ſees clearly, That 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10507:28"/> all that Doctrine, which wrought this great cure vpon vs,
in the Reformation, is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the two <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> in the 39.
<hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and in the 2. <hi>Bookes of Homilies.</hi> And to theſe,
as to <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Abundaries,</hi> from whence all knowledge
neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may abundantly be deriu'd, hee directs the
meditations of Preachers.</p>
                  <p>Are theſe new wayes? No way new: for they were <hi>our
firſt</hi> way in <hi>receiuing Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and our
<hi>firſt</hi> way in <hi>receiuing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> Take a ſhort
view of them all: as it is in the <hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> as it is in the
<hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Homilies.</hi> Firſt you are called
backe to the practiſe of <hi>Catechiſing:</hi> Remember what
<hi>Catechiſing</hi> is; it is <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio viua voce.</hi> And in the
<hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> when thoſe perſons, who comming from the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, might haue beene
ſcandalized with the outward Ceremoniall, and Rituall worſhip of God in the
<hi>Church,</hi> (for Ceremonies are ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes to them who looke
vpon them without their Signification, and without the reaſon of their
Inſtitution) to auoyd that daunger, though they were not <pb n="54" facs="tcp:10507:29"/>
admitted to ſee the <hi>Sacraments</hi> adminiſtred, nor the other Seruice
of God performed in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet in the <hi>Church,</hi> they
receiued <hi>Inſtruction, Inſtitution,</hi> by word of mouth, in the
fundamentall Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and that was
<hi>Catechiſing.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> had it from the beginning,
and the <hi>Iewes</hi> had it too: for their word <hi>Chanach,</hi> is of that
ſignification, <hi>Initiare,</hi> to enter. <hi>Traine vp a child in the way
he ſhould goe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 22.6</note> 
                     <hi>and when he is

Chinnuch,</hi> which is <hi>Liber Inſtitutionum,</hi> that is, of
<hi>Catechiſme,</hi> is a Booke well knowne amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
euery where, where they are now: Their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is their Catechiſme.
And if wee ſhould tell ſome men, That <hi>Caluins Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were
a <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> would they not loue Catechiſing the better for that
name? And would they not loue it the better, if they gaue me leaue to tell them
that of which I had the experience. An Artificer of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie brought his
Childe to mee, to admire (as <pb n="55" facs="tcp:10507:29"/> truly there was much
reaſon) the capacitie, the memory, eſpecially of the child. It was but a
Girle, and not aboue nine yeares of age, her Parents ſaid leſſe, ſome
yeares leſſe; wee could ſcarfe propoſe any Verſe of any Booke, or
Chapter of the <hi>Bible,</hi> but that that childe would goe forward without
Booke. I began to <hi>Catechiſe</hi> this child; and truly, ſhee
vnderſtood nothing of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> nothing of any of thoſe
fundamentall poynts which muſt ſaue vs: and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was doubled, how
ſhe knew ſo much, how ſo little.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> diſcerned this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
of <hi>Catechiſing:</hi> And therefore they inſtituted a particular
<hi>Office,</hi> a <hi>Calling</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Catechiſers.</hi> Which Office, as wee ſee in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi>
42. <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that great man <hi>Optatus</hi> exerciſed at
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> tooke the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi>
and the <hi>Pſalme</hi> of the day, for his Text to one Sermon, did he,
thinke you, much more then paraphraſe, then Catechiſe? When
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> makes one Sermon, and, God knowes, a very ſhort one
too, <hi>Contra omnes Haereſes, To ouerthrow <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10507:30"/> all
Hereſies in one Sermon;</hi> did he, think you, any more then propoſe
fundamentall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which is truly the way to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all
<hi>Hereſies?</hi> When Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> enters into his Sermon
vpon the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> with that preparation,
<hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendite diligenter, non enim rem vulgarem polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemur, Now hearken
diligently,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>for it is no ordinary matter that I
propoſe,</hi> There he propoſes <hi>Catechiſticall Doctrine</hi> of faith
and works. Come to lower times, when <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſologus</hi> makes ſixe or
ſeuen Sermons vpon the <hi>Creed,</hi> and not a ſeuerall Sermon vpon euery
ſeuerall Article, but takes the whole <hi>Creed</hi> for his Text, in euery
Sermon, and ſcarſe any of thoſe Sermons a quarter of an houre long, will
you not allowe this manner of Preaching to bee <hi>Catechiſing?</hi> Goe as
lowe as can bee gone, to the <hi>Ieſuites;</hi> and that great
<hi>Catechizer</hi> amongſt them, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius,</hi> ſayes, <hi>Nos hoc
munus ſuſcipimus:</hi> Wee, wee Ieſuites make Catechiſing our
Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I doubt not but they doe recreate themſelues ſometimes in
other matters too, but that they glory in, that they are <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers.</hi>
And in that Profeſsion, ſayes hee, wee <pb n="57" facs="tcp:10507:30"/> haue <hi>Saint
Baſil, Saint Auguſtine, Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Saint Cyrill,</hi> in our
Societie; and truly as <hi>Catechizers,</hi> they haue; as
<hi>State-Friers,</hi> as <hi>Ieſuits,</hi> they haue not. And in the firſt
Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie they haue him, who is more then all; for as hee ſayes rightly,
<hi>Ipſe Chriſtus Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, Chriſts owne Preaching was a
Catechiſing.</hi> I pray <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Ieſuites</hi> concluſion
of that <hi>Epistle</hi> of his, be true ſtill; There he ſayes, <hi>Si
nihil aliud, If nothing elſe, yet this alone ſhould prouoke vs to a greater
diligence in Catechiſing; Improbus labor, &amp; indeſeſſa cura, That
our Aduerſaries, the Proteſtants doe ſpend ſo much time,</hi> as he
ſayes, <hi>day and night in catechizing.</hi> Now, if it were ſo then, when
he writ, and bee not ſo ſtill amongſt vs, wee haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted one of
our beſt aduantages: and therefore <hi>God</hi> hath graciouſly raiſed a
bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and a Royall Inſtrument, to call vs back to that, which
aduantaged vs, and ſo much offended the Enemy. That man may ſleepe with a
good Conſcience, of hauing diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his dutie in his Miniſtery, that
hath preached in the forenoone, and Catechiſed after. <hi>Quaere,</hi>
ſayes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> (and he ſayes that with indignation) <hi>an
Idolatriam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittat, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10507:31"/> qui de Idolis catechizat:</hi> Will
any man doubt, ſayes he, whether that man be an Idolatrer, that catechiſes
Children, and Seruants in Idolatry? Will any man doubt, whether hee bee
painfull in his Miniſterie, that catechiſes children, and ſeruant in the
ſincere Religion of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> The <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath
ſtill made her vſe of vs; of our fortunes, when ſhe gouernd here, and of
our example, ſince ſhe did not: They did, as they ſaw vs doe; And
thereupon they came to that order, in the <hi>Councell of Trent, That vpon
Sundayes and Holydayes, they ſhould Preach in the forenoone, and Catechiſe
in the afternoone;</hi> till we did both, they did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.3</note>

iuſtly gaue offence, yet none was giuen nor taken in this) That theſe

                  <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> is in the <hi>Catechiſme;</hi> the

which, if his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi> had not named, yet had beene imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his

<hi>Article</hi> appoynts the reading of them: both thoſe, which were
publiſhed in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, and thoſe which
after. In the firſt Booke, the very firſt <hi>Homilies</hi> are, of the
<hi>Sufficiencie of Scriptures, and of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſsitie of Reading
them;</hi> ſufficiently oppoſed againſt that which hath been ſayd in
that <hi>Church,</hi> both of the <hi>impertinencie,</hi> of
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> as not abſolutely neceſſarie, and of the

many ſeuerall <hi>Eaſter daies,</hi> at his <hi>Arch-biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike of
Alexandria,</hi> and his <hi>Chriſtmas dayes Sermons</hi> too, were
ordinarily exſcrib'd, and rehearſed ouer againe, by the moſt part of the
Clergie of thoſe parts: and in their Mouthes they were but <hi>Homilies.</hi>
And <hi>Caluins Homilies</hi> vpon <hi>Iob</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> in his
Preface before them, calls them) were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily repeated ouer againe in many
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and in their mouthes they were but
<hi>Homilies.</hi> It is but the name, that ſcandalizes; and yet the name of
<hi>Homilia</hi> and <hi>Concio,</hi> a <hi>Homily</hi> and a <hi>Sermon,</hi>
is all one. And if ſome of theſe were ſpoken, and not reade, and ſo
exhibited in the name of a Sermon, they would like them well inough. Certainely
his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> miſtooke it <pb n="63" facs="tcp:10507:33"/> not, that in our
<hi>Catechiſmes,</hi> In our <hi>Articles,</hi> in our <hi>Homilies,</hi>
there is inough for <hi>Poſitiue,</hi> inough for <hi>Controuerted
Diuinitie;</hi> For that <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> that intended to bring in the whole
body of Controuerted Diuinitie into his booke, (whom we named before) deſired
no other Subiect, no other occaſion to doe that, but the
<hi>Catechiſme</hi> of that Church; neither need any ſober Man, that
intends to handle Controuerſies aske more, or go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Maieſtie</hi> therefore, who as he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
his duty to <hi>God,</hi> ſo doth he his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects duties to him, might
iuſtly thinke, <hi>That theſe ſo well grounded Directions, might,</hi>
(as himſelfe ſayes) <hi>bee receiu'd vpon implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Yet
hee vouchſafes to communicate to all, who deſire ſatisfaction, the
<hi>Reaſons</hi> that mou'd him. Some of which I haue related, and all which,
all may, when they will ſee, and haue. Of all which the Summ is, His
<hi>Royall</hi> and his <hi>Paſtorall</hi> care, that <hi>by that Primitiue
way of Preaching, his Subiects might be arm'd againſt all kind of
Aduerſaries, in fundamentall truthes.</hi> And when he takes knowledge,
<hi>That ſome few Church-men, but <pb n="64" facs="tcp:10507:34"/> many of the people,
haue made ſiniſter conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſincere intentions, As hee is
grieued at the heart,</hi> (to giue you his owne wordes) <hi>to ſee euery day
ſo many defections from our religion to Popery and Anabaptiſme;</hi> So
without doubt he is grieued with much bitternes, that any ſhould ſo peruert
his meaning, as to thinke, that theſe <hi>Directions</hi> either
<hi>reſtraind the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Preaching, or abated the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or made a breach to Ignorance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi> of which three
ſcandals he hath been pleaſed to take knowledge. What could any
<hi>Calumniator,</hi> any <hi>Libeller</hi> on the other ſide, haue imagin'd
more oppoſit, more contrary to him, then approaches towards
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Superſtition?</hi> Let vs ſay for him, Can ſo
learned, ſo abundantly learned a <hi>prince</hi> be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to plot
for <hi>Ignorance?</hi> And let vs bleſſe <hi>God,</hi> that we heare him
ſay now, <hi>That he doth conſtantly profeſſe himſelfe an open
aduerſary to the Superſtition of the Papiſt</hi> (without any milder
Modification) and <hi>to the madneſſe of the Anabaptiſt:</hi> And that
<hi>the preaching againſt either of their Doctrines is not only approued, but
much commended by his royall Maieſtie, if it bee done without rude and
vndecent reuiling.</hi> If hee <pb n="65" facs="tcp:10507:34"/> had affected
<hi>Ignorance</hi> in himſelfe, he would neuer haue read ſo much; and if he
had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Ignorance</hi> in vs, hee would neuer haue writ ſo much,
and made vs ſo much the more learned by his Books. And if hee had had any
declination towards <hi>Superſtition,</hi> he would not haue gone ſo much
farther, then his rank and qualitie preſſed him to doe, in declaring his
opinion concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as out of <hi>Zeale,</hi> and
<hi>zeale with knowledge</hi> hee hath done. We haue him now, (and long, long,
O eternall <hi>God,</hi> continue him to vs,) we haue him now for a
<hi>father</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Foſter-father;</hi> ſuch a
father as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was; our poſterity
ſhall haue him for a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Claſsique father;</hi> ſuch a
father as <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> was. And when his works
ſhall ſtand in the <hi>Libraries</hi> of our Poſteritie, amongſt the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> euen theſe <hi>Papers,</hi> theſe <hi>Directions,</hi>
&amp; theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> ſhalbe pregnant euidences for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant
zeale to <hi>Gods</hi> truth, and in the meane time, as arrowes ſhot in their
eyes, that imagine ſo vaine a thing, as a defection in him, to their
ſuperſtition. Thus far he is from admitting <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and from
<hi>Superstition</hi> thus far, which ſeemes to be one <pb n="66" facs="tcp:10507:35"/>
of their feares. And for the other two, (which concurre in one) <hi>That
theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould reſtraine the Exerciſe of Preaching, or abate
the number of Sermons,</hi> his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath declar'd himſelfe to
thoſe <hi>Reuerend Fathers, To be ſo far from giuing the leaſt
diſcouragement to ſolid Preaching, or to diſcreet and religious
Preachers, or from abating the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that hee expects at their
hands, that this ſhould increaſe their number, by renuing vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Sunday in the afternoon, in all Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the kingdome,
that primitiue, and moſt profitable expoſition of the Catechiſme.</hi> So
that heere is no abating of Sermons, but a direction of the Preacher to preach
vſefully, and to edification.</p>
                  <p>And therfore, to end all, you, you whom <hi>God</hi> hath made
<hi>Starres</hi> in this <hi>Firmament, Preachers</hi> in this <hi>Church,</hi>
deliuer your ſelues from that imputation,<note place="margin">Iob 25.5</note>
                     <hi>The Starres were not pure in his ſight;</hi> The Preachers were not
obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him in the voice of his <hi>Lieutenant.</hi> And you, you who are
<hi>Gods</hi> holy people, and zealous of his glory, as you know from St.
<hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>that Stars differ
from Stars in glory,</hi> but all conduce to the benefit of man: So, 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10507:35"/> when you ſee theſe <hi>Stars,</hi> Preachers to differ
in gifts; yet, ſince all their ends are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance your ſaluation,
encourage the <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> as well as the curious Preacher. Looke ſo
farre towards your way to Heauen, as to the Firmament, and conſider there,
that that ſtarre by which wee ſaile, and make great voyages, is none of the
ſtarres of the greateſt magnitude; but yet it is none of the leaſt
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but a middle ſtarre. Thoſe Preachers which muſt ſaue your
ſoules, are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, vnlearned, extemporall men; but they are not ouer
curious men neither. Your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are you, and your ſeruants are you; and
you doe not prouide for your ſaluation, if you prouide not for them, who are
ſo much yours, as that they are you. No man is ſau'd as a <hi>good
man,</hi> if he be not ſau'd as a <hi>good Father,</hi> and as a <hi>good
Master</hi> too, if <hi>God</hi> haue giuen him a family. That ſo,

to propagate <pb n="2" facs="tcp:10507:40"/> his <hi>Goſpell</hi> ouer all the world:
Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, you are <hi>Actors</hi> vpon the ſame Stage too: the vttermoſt

dryed vp one <hi>Red Sea</hi> for his firſt people, and hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out
another <hi>Red Sea,</hi> his owne Bloud, for them and vs. When man was fallen,
<hi>God</hi> cloathed him, made him a Leather Garment, there <hi>God</hi>
deſcended to one occupation: when the time of mans redemption was come, then
<hi>God,</hi> as it were, to houſe him, became a <hi>Carpenters Sonne,</hi>
there <hi>God</hi> deſcended to another Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Naturally, without

ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe two kindes man would haue done of himſelfe, though
hee had had no patterne from <hi>God:</hi> but <pb n="3" facs="tcp:10507:40"/> in

deſcended to a third occupation, to be his <hi>Shipwright</hi> to giue him

not to houſe our ſelues, but to houſe him, in erecting <hi>Churches,</hi>
to his glory: So <hi>God</hi> taught vs to make Ships, not to tranſport our

<hi>Text,</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were preſent and
queſtioned him at his <hi>Aſcention,</hi> but they are in their iuſt
extention, and due accomodation, appliable to our preſent occaſion of
meeting heere: As <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe is <hi>Alpha,</hi> and
<hi>Omega,</hi> ſo firſt, as that hee is laſt too, ſo theſe wordes
which he ſpoke in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to vs, who are to glorifie him
in the <hi>Weſt? That we hauing receiued pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, after that the</hi> Holy

Ieruſalem, <hi>and in all</hi> Iudea, <hi>and in</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, <hi>and vnto
the vttermoſt parts of the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt word of the Text is the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10507:41"/>
                        <hi>Cardinall</hi> word, the word the <hi>hinge</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the whole
<hi>Text</hi> turnes; The firſt word, <hi>But,</hi> is the <hi>But,</hi> that
all the reſt ſhoots at. Firſt it is an <hi>excluſiue</hi> word;
ſomething the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which might not bee had; not
that; And it is an <hi>incluſiue</hi> word; ſomthing <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
pleaſd to affoord to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which they thought not of; not
that, not that which you beat vpon, <hi>But,</hi> but yet, ſomething elſe,
ſomething better then that, you ſhall haue. That which this but,
<hi>excludes,</hi> is that which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſſe in the
<hi>Verſe</hi> immediatly before the <hi>Text, a Temporall Kingdome; Wilt
thou reſtore againe the kingdome of Iſrael?</hi> No; not a temporall
Kingdome, let not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and commodities of this world, be in your
contemplation in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures. Or, becauſe they aske more, <hi>Wilt thou
now reſtore that?</hi> not yet: If I will giue you riches, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this world, yet if I doe it not at <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10507:42"/> firſt, if I doe it
not yet, be not you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; you ſhall not haue <hi>that,</hi> that is
not <hi>Gods</hi> firſt intention, and though that be in Gods intention, to
giue it you hereafter, you ſhall not haue it yet, thats the
<hi>excluſiue</hi> part; <hi>But;</hi> there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>incluſiue, You
ſhall receiue power, after that the Holy Ghoſt is come vpon you, and you
ſhall bee witneſſes vnto mee, both in</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>and in
all</hi> Iudaea, <hi>and in</hi> Samaria, <hi>and vnto the vttermoſt parts of
the Earth.</hi> In which ſecond part, we ſhall paſſe by theſe
ſteps; <hi>Superueniet Spiritus,</hi> The <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhall come
vpon you, <hi>The Spirit</hi> ſhall witneſſe to <hi>your Spirit,</hi> and
rectifie your Conſcience; And then, by that, you ſhall receiue
<hi>power;</hi> A new power beſides the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you haue from the
<hi>State,</hi> and that power ſhall enable you, to be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, to make his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine the more credible, by your
teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when you conforme your ſelues to him, and doe as hee did; and
this <pb n="7" facs="tcp:10507:42"/> witneſſe you ſhall beare, this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity you
ſhall declare, firſt in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in this <hi>Citie;</hi> And
in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> in all the parts of the <hi>Kingdome;</hi> and in

of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and to the vttermoſt part of the
Earth, to thoſe poore <hi>Soules,</hi> to whom you are continually ſending.
Summarily, If from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> you haue a good teſtimony in
your owne Conſcience, you ſhall be witneſſes for <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
that is, as he did, you ſhall giue ſatisfaction to all, to the

                     <p>FIrſt then, this firſt word, <hi>But,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a
temporall Kingdome; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had fild themſelues with an
expectation, with an ambition of it; but that was not intended them. It was no
wonder, that a woman could conceiue ſuch an expectation, and ſuch an
ambition, as to haue her two ſonnes ſit at <hi>Chriſts</hi> right
hand,<note place="margin">Mat. 20.20.</note> and at his left, in his Kingdome,
when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expected ſuch a Kingdome, as might affoord them
honours and preferment vpon Earth. More then once they were in the
diſputation, in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> deprehended them, <hi>which of them
ſhould bee the greateſt in his Kingdome.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat.
1.81.</note> Neither hath the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> any thing, wherein he
may ſo properly call himſelfe <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> as this error of the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> this theire infirmitie; that he is euermore too
conuerſant vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation <pb n="9" facs="tcp:10507:43"/> of temporall
Kingdomes. They did it all the way, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was with them, and
now at his laſt ſtep, <hi>Cum actu aſcendiſſet,</hi> when
<hi>Chriſt</hi> was not <hi>Aſending,</hi> but in part <hi>aſcended,</hi>
when one foot was vpon the Earth, and the other in the cloud that tooke him vp,
they aske him now, wilt thou at this time, reſtore the Kingdome? ſo women
put their husbands, and men their fathers, and friends, vpon their torture, at
their laſt gaſpe, and make their death bed a racke to make them ſtrech
and encreaſe ioyntures, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and legacies, and ſigne Scedules and
Codicils, with their hand, when his hand that preſents them is ready to
cloſe his eyes, that ſhould ſigne them: And when they are vpon the wing
for heauen, men tye lead to their feet, and when they are laying hand faſt
vpon <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, they muſt pull their hand out of his
boſome againe, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey importunities of men, and ſigne <pb n="10" facs="tcp:10507:44"/> their papers: ſo vnderminable is the loue of this World, which
determines euery minute. <hi>GOD,</hi> as hee is three perſons, hath three
Kingdomes; There is <hi>Regnum potentiae,</hi> The Kingdome of power; and this
wee attribute to the <hi>Father;</hi> it is power and prouidence: There is
<hi>Regnum gloriae,</hi> the Kingdome of glorie; this we attribute to the
<hi>Sonn</hi> and to his purchaſe; for he is <hi>the King</hi> that ſhall
ſay,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.34.</note> 
                        <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, from the foundation of the
World.</hi> And then betweene theſe three is <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Gratiae,</hi> The
Kingdome of Grace, and this we attribute to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> he takes
them, whom the king of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Almighty <hi>God</hi> hath reſcued from the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 4.11.</note> and as the king of
grace, <hi>Hee giues them the knowledge of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Kingdome
of</hi> GOD, that is, of <hi>future glory,</hi> by ſanctifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his
grace, in his <hi>Church.</hi> The two firſt kingdomes are in this world, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10507:44"/> yet neither of them, are of this world; becauſe both
they referre to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. The kingdome of the <hi>Father,</hi>
which is the prouidence of <hi>God,</hi> does but preſerue vs, The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> which is the grace of <hi>God,</hi> does but
prepare vs to the kingdome of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> which is the glory of
<hi>GOD;</hi> and thats in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And therfore, though to good men, this
world be the way to that kingdome, yet this kingdome is not of this world,
ſayes Chiſt himſelfe: Though the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelues,<note place="margin">Iohn 18.36.</note> as good a <hi>Schoole</hi> as they were bred
in, could neuer take out that leſſon yet that leſſon <hi>Chriſt</hi>
giues, and repeates to all, you ſeeke a Temporall kingdome, <hi>But,</hi>
ſayes the Text, ſtop there, A king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome you muſt not haue.</p>
                     <p>Beloued in him, whoſe kingdome, and Goſpell you ſeeke
to aduance, in this Plantation, our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sauiour Christ
Ieſus,</hi> if you ſeeke to eſtabliſh a <pb n="12" facs="tcp:10507:45"/> temporall
kingdome there, you are not rectified, if you ſeeke to bee <hi>kings</hi> in
either acceptation of the word; To be a <hi>King</hi> ſignifies
<hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pency,</hi> and <hi>Supremacie,</hi> to bee
vnder no man, and to be a <hi>King</hi> ſignifies <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> and
<hi>Omniſufficiencie,</hi> to neede no man. If thoſe that gouerne there,
would eſtabliſh ſuch a gouernment, as ſhould not depend vpon this, or
if thoſe that goe thither, propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues an exemption from
Lawes, to liue at their libertie, this is to be <hi>Kings,</hi> to deueſt
<hi>Allegeance,</hi> to bee vnder no man: and if thoſe that aduenture
thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, propoſe to themſelues preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and profit, a ſodaine
way to bee rich, and an aboundance of all deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commodities from thence,
this is to be ſufficient of themſelues, and to neede no man: and to bee
vnder no man and to neede no man, are the two acceptations of being
<hi>Kings.</hi> Whom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty drawes to goe, or preſent profit 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10507:45"/> drawes to aduenture, are not yet in the right way. O, if
you could once bring a <hi>Catechiſme</hi> to bee as good ware a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them as a Bugle, as a knife, as a hatchet: O, if you would bee as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to
hearken at the returne of a <hi>ſhip,</hi> how many <hi>Indians</hi> were
conuerted to <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as what trees, or druggs, or Dyes that
Ship had brought, then you were in your right way, and not till then;
<hi>Libertie</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> are Characters of kingdomes, and a
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is excluded in the <hi>Text;</hi> The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> were not
to looke for it, in their employment, nor you in this your Plantation.</p>
                     <p>At leaſt CHRIST expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus farre, in
this anſwer, that if he would giue them a kingdome,<note place="margin">Non
adhuc.</note> hee would not giue it them yet. They aske him, <hi>Wilt thou at
this time, reſtore the kingdome?</hi> and hee anſwers, <hi>It is not for
you to know the times:</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>God</hi> will doe, Man muſt not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10507:46"/> appoint him his time. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> thought of a
<hi>kingdome</hi> preſently after <hi>Chriſts</hi> departure; the comming
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who lead them into all truthes, ſoone deliuered
them of that error. Other men in fauour of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> interpreting all
the propheſies, which are of a <hi>Spirituall Kingdome,</hi> the kingdome of
the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> into which, the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall be admitted) in
a literall ſenſe, haue thought that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall haue, not
onely a temporall kingdome in the ſame place, in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> againe,
but becauſe they finde that kingdome which is promiſed, (that is the
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Goſpell</hi>) to bee expreſſed in large phraſes,
and in an abundant manner, applying all that largeneſſe to a temporall
kingdome, they thinke, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhall haue ſuch a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as ſhall ſwallow and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all other kingdomes, and bee the ſole
<hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the world. After this, very great men

                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:10507:46"/> vpon theſe words, of One

<hi>Chriſt</hi> denies that he himſelfe knew that, as <hi>Man;</hi> and as
<hi>Man, Chriſt</hi> knew more, then euer the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> knew.
What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> intended to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi>

You cannot ſowe your Corne to day, and ſay it ſhall bee aboue ground to

yet this <hi>Plant</hi> was Foure thouſand yeares after before it appeared;
this <hi>Meſsias</hi> Foure thouſand yeares before he came. <hi>GOD</hi>
ſhew'd the ground where that ſhould grow, Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares after the

it was Foure hundred yeares after that, before they had a <hi>King.</hi> GOD
meant from the firſt houre, to people the whole earth; and <hi>God</hi> could
haue made men of clay, as faſt as they made Brickes of Clay in

vpon eight perſons; and they haue ſeru'd to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Earth</hi> and

beene formerly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> At the three latter times it is

that, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> fell then vpon the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,

and then it conuayd a Counſell into the Prince to doe them after.) As their

<hi>Sabboth,</hi> that God planted himſelfe, euen in himſelfe, in his owne
reſt, from the Creation. But the root, and thoſe branches which grow from
that root, are of the ſame nature, and the ſame name: And therefore as well
of the flower, as of the root of a Roſe, or of a Violet, we would ſay, This

Feaſts of <hi>Gods</hi> inſtitution, as to the firſt <hi>Sabboth,
God</hi> giues that name; hee cals thoſe ſeuerall Feaſts which he

howſoeuer all <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> haue a ceremoniall part in them, yet there
is a <hi>Morall</hi> part that inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them all; they are elemented of
<hi>Ceremonie,</hi> but they animated with <hi>Moralitie.</hi> And that
<hi>Moralitie</hi> is in them all, <hi>Reſt:</hi> for if <hi>Adam</hi> could

<hi>Sabboth</hi> according to the nature of it, and <hi>Sabboth</hi> is
<hi>Reſt.</hi> It is a <hi>Reſt</hi> of two kindes; our reſt, and
<hi>Gods</hi> reſt. Our reſt is the ceſſation from labour on thoſe
dayes; <hi>Gods</hi> reſt, is our ſanctifying of the day: for ſo in the

<hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> ſo though he take a ſeuenth part of our time in the
<hi>Sabboth,</hi> yet he takes more too, he appoints other <hi>Sabboths,</hi>
other <hi>Feſtiualls,</hi> that he may haue more glory, and we more Reſt:
for all wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe two concurre, are <hi>Sabboths. Vacate &amp; videte

                     <note place="margin">Leuit. 23.</note> and a
<hi>Humiliate animas,</hi> bodily reſt, and ſpirituall ſanctifying of the

<hi>Morall;</hi> and this is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> too, that all things in the
ſeruice of God bee done in order; and this alſo, that obedience be giuen to
Superiours, in thoſe things wherein they are Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. And therfore it was
to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as well <hi>Morall,</hi> to obſerue the certaine dayes
which <hi>God</hi> had determined, as to obſerue any at all. Not that Gods
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement limitting the dayes, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a <hi>Moralitie</hi> into thoſe
particular dayes: for <hi>Moralitie</hi> is perpetuall; and if that had been
<hi>Morall,</hi> it muſt haue been ſo before, and it muſt bee ſo
ſtill; <hi>Gods</hi> determining the dayes did not infuſe, not induce a
<hi>Moralitie</hi> there, but it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened a former <hi>Moralitie,</hi> that
is, an obedience to the commandement, for that time, which <hi>God</hi> had

And many of thoſe <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> deriu'd from the <hi>Iewes:</hi> and
not vnlawfull, for that. The <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which
had their foundation in the prefiguration of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and were types
of him, were vnlawfull after <hi>Christ</hi> was come; becauſe the vſe of
them, then, implyed a deniall or a doubt of his being come. But thoſe
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which, though the <hi>Iewes</hi> 
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:10507:82"/>
vſed them, had their foundation in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as bowing of the knee,
lifting vp the eyes, and hands, and many, very many others, which either
teſtified their deuotion that did them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted their deuotion that
ſawe them done, are not therefore excluded the <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe
they were in vſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iewes.</hi> That <hi>Pope</hi> whom we
named before, <hi>Hyginus,</hi> the eighth after <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> he
inſtituted, <hi>Ne Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilica ſine Miſſa conſecretur. That no Church
bee conſecrated without a Maſſe.</hi> If this muſt binde vs, to a
<hi>Maſſe</hi> of the preſent <hi>Romane Church,</hi> it were hard; and
yet not very hard truely; for they are eaſily had. But that word,
<hi>Maſſe,</hi> is in <hi>Saint Ambroſe,</hi> in <hi>Saint
Auguſtine</hi> in ſome very ancient <hi>Councels;</hi> and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intends nothing, to this purpoſe, but the Seruice, the Common Prayer of the
<hi>Church,</hi> then in vſe, there. And when the Biſhop
<hi>Panigarola</hi> ſayes in his Sermon vpon <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> that the 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10507:82"/> 
                     <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> found the bleſſed
<hi>Virgin</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at <hi>Maſſe,</hi> I preſume
hee meanes no more, then that they were mett at ſuch publique Prayer, as at
thoſe times they might make. Sure <hi>Pope Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Pope
Hyginus</hi> meane the ſame thing, when one ſayes <hi>Miſſa
conſecretur,</hi> and the other <hi>Diuinis Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> One ſayes,
<hi>Let the Conſecration bee with a Maſſe,</hi> the other, <hi>with
Diuine Seruice;</hi> the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was then the
<hi>Maſſe.</hi> In a word, a conſtant forme of Conſecrations, wee finde
none that goes through our <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls:</hi> the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were
ſtill more or leſſe, as they were more or leſſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, or might
bee ſubiect to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize, or to be miſ-interpreted. And therefore I am
not heere either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or ſo much as to remember, that which
appertaines to the manner of theſe Conſecrations; onely in concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in
that, which is the Soule of all, humble and heartie prayer, that <hi>God</hi> 
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:10507:83"/> will heare his Seruants in this place, I ſhall not
offend to ſay, that I am ſure my zeale is inferiour to none. And more I
ſay not of the firſt Part, The Holy place; and but a little more, of the
other; though at firſt it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for an equall part, <hi>The Holy

<hi>Church</hi> had inſtituted. <hi>Facta ſunt Encaenia,</hi> ſayes the
Text; It was the Feaſt of the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wee know what Dedication this was;
That of <hi>Salomon</hi> was much greater; A Temple built where none was
before; That of <hi>Eſdras</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne was much greater then this,
An intire reedification of that demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Temple, where it was before. This
was but a zealous reſtoring of an Altar in the <hi>Temple:</hi> which hauing
beene prophaned by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelues threw
downe, and erected a new, and dedicated that. <hi>Salomons</hi> Dedication is
called a <hi>Feaſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 5.3.</note> a <hi>Holy

to bee a ſolemne <hi>Feaſt</hi> too. But neither of theſe
<hi>Feaſtes,</hi> though of farre greater Dedications, were
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſarie;</hi> neither commanded to be kept euery yeare; and yet
this, which was ſo much leſſer then the others, the <hi>Church</hi> had
put vnder that Obligation, to bee kept euery yeare; and <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelfe contemnes not, condemnes not, diſputes not the inſtitution of
the <hi>Church.</hi> But as for matter of doctrine hee ſends euen his owne
<hi>Diſciples,</hi> to them who ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chayre, ſo for
matter of Ceremony, he brings euen his owne perſon, to the celebrating, to
the authorizing, to the countenancing of the Inſtitutions of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and reſts in that.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>it was Winter,</hi> ſayes the <hi>Text:</hi>

not ſay, that infirme and weak men, may not fauour themſelues, in a due

of <hi>Princes,</hi> are ſtrange <hi>Betheſdaes;</hi> how quickly they
recouer any man that is brought into that Poole? How much a little change of
ayre does? and how well they can ſtand, and ſtand bare many houres, in the
Priuy Chamber, that would melt and flowe out into Rhumes, and Catarrs, in a
long <hi>Goſpell</hi> heere? But, <hi>Citra Scandalum,</hi> a man may fauour
himſelfe in theſe places: <pb n="38" facs="tcp:10507:86"/> but yet this excuſes not
the irreuerent manner which hath ouertaken vs in all theſe places; That any
<hi>Maſter</hi> may thinke himſelfe to haue the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie heere, as
in his owne houſe, or that that <hi>Seruant,</hi> that neuer puts on his hat
in his <hi>Maſters</hi> preſence all the weeke, on <hi>Sunday,</hi> when
hee and his <hi>Maſter</hi> are in <hi>Gods</hi> preſence, ſhould haue
his hat on perchance before his <hi>Masters. Chriſt</hi> ſhall make
<hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Seruant</hi> equall; but not yet; not heere; nor
euer, equall to himſelfe, how euer they become equall to one another.
<hi>Gods</hi> ſeruice is not a continuall <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that a man
muſt bee heere, and here in ſuch a poſture, and ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though

<hi>Et facta ſint Encaenia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> let this be the Feaſt of the

time, <hi>Si quis noua <pb n="40" facs="tcp:10507:87"/> tunica indueretur, Encaeniare
diceretur. If any man put on a new garment, hee called it by that name,
Encaenia ſua.</hi> Much more is it ſo, if wee renew in our ſelues the
<hi>Image of God,</hi> and put off <hi>the Olde man,</hi> and put on the
<hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This is truly <hi>Encaeniare,</hi> to dedicate,

<hi>Nazian.</hi> in a <hi>Sermon,</hi> or <hi>Oration,</hi> vpon the like

Let mee charge your memories, but with this note more, That when <hi>God</hi>
forbad <hi>Dauid</hi> the building of an Houſe, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was a man
of blood,</hi> at that time <hi>Dauid</hi> had not embrued his hands in
<hi>Vriahs</hi> blood; nor ſhed any blood, but lawfully in iuſt warres; yet
euen that made him vncapable of this fauour to prouide <hi>God</hi> a houſe.
Some callings are in their nature more obnoxious, and more expoſed to
ſinne, then others are: accompanied with more tentations; &amp; 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10507:87"/> ſo retard vs more in holy duties. And therefore as there
are particular ſinnes that attend certaine <hi>places,</hi> certaine
<hi>ages,</hi> certaine <hi>complexions,</hi> and certaine <hi>voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
let vs watch our ſelues in all thoſe, and remember that not only the
high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees of thoſe ſinns, but any thing that conduces therunto,
prophanes the Conſecration, and Dedication of this <hi>Temple,</hi> our
ſelues, to the ſeruice of <hi>God;</hi> it annihilates our repentance, and
fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates our former reconciliations to him. <hi>Almighty God worke in you
a perfit dedication of your ſelues at this time; that ſo, receiuing it from
hands dedicated to God, hee whoſe holy Office this is, may preſent
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably this Houſe to God in your behalfes, and eſtabliſh an

he take <pb n="4" facs="tcp:10507:91"/> it almoſt as granted, that <hi>Foundations are
deſtroyed, (And then, what can the righteous doe?)</hi> as it is in the third
verſe which is our <hi>Text,</hi> yet in this diſtreſſe he findes what
to doe. For as hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in the firſt verſe, <hi>In thee Lord, put I my
truſt:</hi> So after he had paſſed the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration of his dangers, in
the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third verſes, in the fourth he purſues it as he begun,
<hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lords Throane is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> And
in the fifth hee fixes it thus, <hi>The Lord tryeth the Righteous,</hi> (he may
ſuffer much to be done for their triall) <hi>but the wicked, and him that
loueth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, his ſoule hateth.</hi> This then is the
<hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> this is the <hi>Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the righteous
Man; In Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall things, in Circumſtantiall things, in things that are
not fundamentall, a righteous Man, a conſtant Man ſhould not bee ſhaked
at all, not at all Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized; Thats true; But then, (in a ſecond place)
ſometimes it comes to <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10507:91"/> that, <hi>That Foundations are
deſtroyd, and what can the Righteous doe then?</hi> Why euen then, this is a
queſtion, not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, that nothing can bee done, but of
Conſultation with God, what ſhould be done. I know, ſayes <hi>Dauid,</hi>
I ſhould not be, and thou knoweſt, O God, I haue not beene mou'd with
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary trialls; not though my Friends haue diſ-auowed mee, and bid <hi>mee
flye to the Mountaine as a Bird,</hi> not though mine enemies prepare, and
<hi>prepare Arrowes,</hi> and ſhoote, and <hi>ſhoote priuily,</hi>
(beſtowe their labour, and their coſt, and their witts, to ruine mee) yet
theſe haue not moou'd mee, becauſe I had fixed my ſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine
<hi>Foundations,</hi> Confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Aſſurances of Deliuerance from
thee. But if, O Lord, I ſee theſe foundations deſtroyed, if thou put mee
into mine Enemies hand, if thou make them thy Sword, if their furie draw that
Sword, and then, thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10507:92"/> Arme, ſinewed euen with
thine owne indignation, ſtrike with that ſword, what can I, how righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
ſoeuer I were, doe? So then, for the <hi>Explication,</hi> and
<hi>Application</hi> of theſe words, there will need no more, but to ſpread
them by way of <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> vpon theſe three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:<note place="margin">Diuiſio.</note> Firſt, That the righteous is bolde as a

themſelues may bee deſtroyed, and ſo hee may bee ſhaked; If hee bee,

a houſe which is the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Houſe;</hi> for as e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uery
Man is a little World, ſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is his owne Houſe, and dwels in

                  <p>As in the <hi>Bill of Diuorce,</hi> ſo in this <hi>bill of

The word indeed, is originally <hi>Naſhah,</hi> and <hi>Naſhah</hi> is an

from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to vs?) yet when all this is multiplied infinitely, it
was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly ouerpayd, if but one drop of the bloud of the <hi>Sonne of
